# PROTOTYPE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN JAVASCRIPT

### Description
Javascript is described as prototype oriented language. This project uses well thought-out examples to illustrate why it is so. The project uses OOP to replicate real life behaviours of objects around us. This project is based on the article [Prototype Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@boscoseries/prototype-oriented-programming-e855e60844cd). Read along for greater understanding.
